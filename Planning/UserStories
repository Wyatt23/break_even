Break Even

Overview (right now these are just  free form ideas)
Make a fitness app that allows a user to pick out what kind of workout they do and log how many reps or how far they ran and relate that to how many calories they burned. We would like to have a schedule that the person can view and checkboxes to mark off if theyâ€™ve done it.  If there is no such API perhaps we could turn it into a game of some kind.
